## Everyday Design System — Agent Rules (local)

These rules are a project-local reminder for AI agents working in this repo.

### Repository hygiene
- Maintain the `.cursor/` folder structure:
	- `.cursor/rules/`
	- `.cursor/tools/`
	- `.cursor/docs/`
	- `.cursor/notes/`
- Keep `.cursor/notes/` updated during work:
	- `project_checklist.md`: steps + status
	- `notebook.md`: findings/decisions
	- `agentnotes.md`: critical context for future sessions

### UX + implementation constraints
- Mirror the information architecture and page patterns of the eBay Playbook as the initial baseline (structure-first; content can be placeholder).
- Default to a public site (no auth gating) unless explicitly requested.
- Use **Work Sans** as primary typeface and **Geist Mono** as monospace.
- Prefer icon components over emojis in UI.
